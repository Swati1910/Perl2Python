Perl2Python
===========

Perl to Python code translator.


The task is to write a Perl compiler. Generally compilers take a high level language as input and output assembler, which can then can be directly executed. Your compiler will take a Perl script as input and output a Python script. Such a translation is useful because programmers sometimes need to convert Perl scripts to Python.

Possible reasons for this include integration of existing Perl code into a Python program and shifting a complete Perl prgram to a new platform which requires Python, such as Google's app engine.

Your task in this assignment is to automate this conversion. You must write a Perl program which takes as input a Perl script and outputs an equivalent Python program.
